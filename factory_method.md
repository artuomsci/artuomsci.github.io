### Brief Summary  
The **Factory Method** pattern is represented as a **covariant functor** between the category of Creator types and the category of Product types. This functor maps each Creator to its associated Product, preserving the inheritance hierarchy. The pattern's type-level polymorphism is captured by the functor's structure.

### Category-Theoretic Representation  
**Let**:  
- $\mathcal{C}$ denote the **category of Creator types**, where:  
  - Objects are abstract Creator $C$ and concrete Creators $C_i$.  
  - Morphisms $f_i: C_i \to C$ represent subclassing (e.g., inclusion of $C_i$ into $C$).  
- $\mathcal{P}$ denote the **category of Product types**, where:  
  - Objects are abstract Product $P$ and concrete Products $P_i$.  
  - Morphisms $g_i: P_i \to P$ represent subclassing.  
- $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{P}$ denote a **functor** such that:  
  - $F(C) = P$,  
  - $F(C_i) = P_i$,  
  - $F(f_i: C_i \to C) = g_i: P_i \to P$.  

### Explanation  
1. **Functorial Mapping**:  
   $F$ associates each concrete Creator $C_i$ with its corresponding Product $P_i$, ensuring type compatibility.  
2. **Preservation of Hierarchy**:  
   Subclassing morphisms $f_i$ in $\mathcal{C}$ map to Product morphisms $g_i$ in $\mathcal{P}$, enforcing that $C_i$ produces $P_i$.  
3. **Abstract Base**:  
   The abstract Creator $C$ maps to the abstract Product $P$, defining the factory method's type signature.  

### Why This Works  
- **Type Consistency**: The functor guarantees that $C_i$ cannot produce $P_j$ ($i \neq j$), as $F(C_i) = P_i$.  
- **Polymorphism**: Clients interact with $P$ via $F(C)$, decoupling them from concrete $P_i$.  
- **Extensibility**: Adding $C_{new} \to C$ in $\mathcal{C}$ induces $P_{new} \to P$ in $\mathcal{P}$ via $F$.  

### Validity  
1. **Functor Laws**:  
   - **Identity**: $`F(\mathrm{id}_C) = \mathrm{id}_{P}`$.  
   - **Composition**: $F(f_j \circ f_i) = F(f_j) \circ F(f_i)$.  
2. **Compatibility**:  
   Morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ align, ensuring $C_i \to C$ implies $P_i \to P$.  

### Example  
- **Abstract Factory Method**: $F(C) = P$ (abstract Product).  
- **Concrete Factory Method**: $F(C_1) = P_1$ (ConcreteProduct1).  
- **Client Code**: Uses $P$ via $F(C)$, unaware of $P_1$. When $C_1$ is substituted for $C$, $P_1$ is automatically selected.
